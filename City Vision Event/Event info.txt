CITY VISION

Smart City is one of the most used terms to depict the growing efforts put into devising a strategy for achieving urban growth in a “smart” manner through innovative and sustainable policies. Many different meanings can be attached to the word smart, resulting in various alternative labels, such as intelligent city, knowledge city, ubiquitous city, and sustainable city.

The element of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) was incredibly relevant in the early definitions of a smart city. Although according to some studies, this dimension remains central, the interpretation of the elements enabling smartness has evolved, ranging from the relevance of the ICT dimension to the inclusion of human capital and education. Consequently, the idea of a smart city can find its core components in the creation and connection of technology infrastructure, human capital, and social capital to enhance sustainability and improve the quality of life.

The event "Stati generali delle città intelligenti" will take place in Padova, and will be the opportunity to discuss sustainable city growth with professionals, scholars, and policymakers. Moreover, a start-up village will host many new ventures whose products/services could favor the transition toward a smart city.
