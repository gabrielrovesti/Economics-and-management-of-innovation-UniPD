Comment 1: Good presentation, clear slides. Mobisec knows it’s offering, so you can skip it if you don't have a critical thinking about it (i. e. identifying strenghts and weaknesses). Page 5: not readable --> increase the size of the font in the cake graph. Channels analysis: is what Mobisec is already doing or is it your proposal? Not clear what is tasks analysis -maybe consider changing the titles of the slide. Improve time management. Goals at the end (move upfront). Future needs: Do you have comments for future initiatives?

Comment 2: Good design (except slide 7); proposal of different analysis. Improvements: explain better how you develop what you called "channel analysis". About the 15k on LinkedIn presence (why not on other social media): is something you find from Mobisec or did you allocate this budget? Maybe I missed the point on such a strong focus on LinkedIn.

Comment 3: I agree with the fact that you do not have to present to Mobsiec what they do because they know. I would focus more on your analysis. How have you chosen the budget? For a SME it is a huge budget in my opinion. Give some examples of posts / article you would publish in your LinkedIn page (e.g. would you focus more on what Mobisec does or would you also share some informative articles? Slide 7: try to find a more interactive way to list your “communication pillars”. Slide 10 is not clear, are those the goals? The results?.
